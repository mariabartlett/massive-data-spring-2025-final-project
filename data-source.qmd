## Research questions

Our research is guided by the following questions:

1) How do the disparities between men's and women's sports vary by institution and sport?

2) What distinct clusters of institutions emerge considering EADA variables for a single academic year?

## Data source

We downloaded the EADA dataset directly from [the Department of Education website](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/datafile/list) (Office of Postsecondary Education, n.d.). One Excel file is available for each academic year 2002-03 to 2022-23. Each dataset includes data on coach salaries, roster information, and recruitment expenses for all applicable male and female college athletic programs. There are approximately 4,000 variables captured within a single academic year. Each observation in the dataset represents a unique higher education institution that met the two noted reporting criteria. While this exact number varies year-to-year, there are approximately 1,800 colleges/universities reflected in a single dataset (Office of Postsecondary Education, n.d.).
