# Research questions & data source

## Research questions

For our final project, we chose to explore the nuances of gender gap in intercollegiate athletics using the EADA datasets. Specifically, our research is guided by the following questions:

1) How do the disparities between men's and women's sports vary by institution and sport?

2) What distinct clusters of institutions emerge considering EADA variables for a single academic year?

## Data source

We downloaded the EADA dataset directly from [the Department of Education website](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/datafile/list). Our EADA dataset consists of csv files, one for each academic year from years 2002-2023. Each dataset includes data on coach salaries, roster information, and recruitment expenses for all applicable male and female college athletic programs. There are approximately 4,000 variables captured within a single academic year. Each observation in the dataset represents a unique higher education institution that met the two criteria previously mentioned. While this exact number varies year-to-year, there are approximately 1,800 colleges/universities reflected in a single dataset.
